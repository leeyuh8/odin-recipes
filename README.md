# Recipes Page
[Live Demo](https://leeyuh8.github.io/recipes/)

## PURPOSE: 
To practice using HTML foundations, learned from The Odin Project, to make a page that links to three different recipes.

## SKILLS USED:
- create and upload through GitHub
- use Git commands through command line (move changes from working, staging, to commit stage; make atomic commits with strong commit messages)
- use VS Code
- HTML boilerplate
- basic text tags (paragraphs, bold, italic, etc.)
- images and link tags with attributes and absolute or relative paths
