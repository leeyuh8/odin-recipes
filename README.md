# odin-recipes

PURPOSE: This project is to practice using HTML foundations learned through the Odin Project. The goal is to use those foundations to make a recipes website.

SKILLS USED:
- create and upload through GitHub
- use Git commands through command line (move changes from working, staging, to commit stage; make atomic commits with strong commit message format)
- use VS Code to write HTML code
- HTML boilerplate
- basic text tags (paragraphs, bold, italic, etc.)
- images and link tags with attributes and absolute or relative paths
