                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash and dry the sweet potatoes. Prick a few holes into them with a fork. Wrap with foil or leave them as is (see blog post for details).</li>
                    <li>Without pre-heating, place them into the oven (you can use a baking tray or place them straight onto the wire rack int he oven) and bake at 325 F for 70-90 minutes OR 375 F for 50-65 minutes (see blog post for textural difference between the two temperatures) or until you can insert a chopstick through the potatoes easily.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the oven and them rest for 10 minutes. Enjoy with your favorite topping, if you choose!</li>
                </ol>
